# nginx.conf
#
# This is the nginx main configuration file.
# Must be placed at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf.
# This file is automatically copied by the setup_nginx.sh script.
#
# I decided to keep the configuration minimal, according to my knowledge of
# nginx. It probably lacks several security settings, but this configuration
# is enough to satisfy the project's requirements.
#
# ---- FEATURES ----
#
# This configuration enable HTTP as well as HTTPS (self-signed SSL certificate
# generated with openssl) for two web services that are phpMyAdmin and Wordpress.

# Wordpress can be reached using the /wordpress route
# phpMyAdmin can be reached using the /phpmyadmin route

# Requesting root (/) will automatically redirect to /wordpress.
# autoindexing is on by default. I put my updated libft at the root
# of the Wordpress website in order to easily demonstrate that
# (try requesting /wordpress/libft).
#
# An SQL database is provided by MariaDB.
# DB credentials are: wordpress:wordpress
#
# Wordpress is automatically installed and configured through the wp-cli tool.
# WP credentials are: admin:wordpress
